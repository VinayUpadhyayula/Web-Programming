This project is a database implementation of persisting the project1 spreadsheet evaluation logic using a popular no sql database MongoDb. The project is setup and implemented as per the requirements given in the project specifications on course website.

I have chosen the database representation as follows(3rd format in the requirements document):
    A collection per spreadsheet. Each collection would contain {cellId, expr} documents with an index on cellId.

Hence my documents are indexed based on cellId.

All the requirements are met and all the 57 tests (including 11 spreadhseet DAO test are green). Also added the code for clear() test case.
